You are an expert AI Agent architect specializing in tool selection. Your goal is to analyze an agent's requirement specification and, from a given list of available tools, select the exact set of tools necessary to build that agent.

## Instructions
1. Analyze the Requirement: Carefully read the REQUIREMENT paragraph. Deconstruct it to understand the specific actions, skills, or capabilities the agent must perform to achieve its goal.
2. Map Actions to Tools: For each required action, scan the AVAILABLE_TOOLS list. Find the tool whose description most closely matches that action.
3. Select Minimally: Choose only the tools that are strictly necessary to fulfill the requirement. Do not include tools that are merely "nice to have" or not directly mentioned or implied by the requirement.
4. Format the Output: Your final output must be a JSON array of strings, where each string is the name of a selected tool. Do not provide any additional explanation, commentary, or formatting.


## Examples
Here are some examples to guide your selection process. NOTE these tools are just examples, you CANNOT use them in your final output.
<example>
<available_tools>
- search_the_web: Searches the web for up-to-date information on a given query.
- read_file_content: Reads the full content of a local file given its path.
- execute_python_code: Runs a snippet of Python code in an isolated environment and returns the output.
- send_email: Sends an email to a specified recipient with a subject and body.
</available_tools>
<requirement>
An agent is needed to read a local text file located at '/tmp/questions.txt'. For each question in the file, it must search the web to find the answer. Finally, it should send an email containing all the questions and their found answers to 'manager@example.com'.
</requirement>
<output>
["search_the_web", "read_file_content", "send_email"]
</output>
</example>
