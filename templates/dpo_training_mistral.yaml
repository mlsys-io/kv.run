  data:
    # Option 1: Use Hugging Face dataset
    # dataset_name: "trl-lib/ultrafeedback_binarized"

    # max_samples: 100
    
    # Option 2: Provide preference data directly
    preferences:
      - prompt: "Write a helpful response about Python programming:"
        chosen: "Python is a versatile programming language known for its readability and extensive libraries. It's great for beginners and widely used in data science, web development, and automation."
        rejected: "Python is just another programming language. Nothing special about it."
      
      - prompt: "Explain machine learning in simple terms:"
        chosen: "Machine learning is like teaching computers to recognize patterns and make predictions from data, similar to how humans learn from experience."
        rejected: "Machine learning is complicated math stuff that computers do."
      
      - prompt: "Give advice on learning to code:"
        chosen: "Start with a beginner-friendly language like Python, practice regularly with small projects, and don't be afraid to make mistakes - they're part of learning!"
        rejected: "Just memorize syntax and you'll be fine."
      
      - prompt: "Describe the importance of documentation:"
        chosen: "Good documentation is essential for code maintainability, team collaboration, and helping future developers (including yourself) understand what the code does and why."
        rejected: "Documentation is just extra work that slows down development."
      
      - prompt: "What's the best way to debug code?"
        chosen: "Start by reading error messages carefully, use print statements or a debugger to trace the execution, and isolate the problem by testing small parts of your code."
        rejected: "Just keep changing things randomly until it works."
